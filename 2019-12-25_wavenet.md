# WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio

## Abstract
- The proposed model is probabilistic and autoregressive
- State-of-the-art performance applied to TTS
- Promising results as a discriminative model

## Introduction
- WaveNet is based on PixelCNN architecture
- Contributions:
  1. Generated signals with subjective naturalness 
  2. Dilated causal convolutions with large receptive fields
  3. Different speaker identities allow for generating different voices
  4. Promising experiment results
   
## WaveNet
### Formulization
Waveform $X = \{x_1, ..., x_T\}$
The joint probability is factorized as a product of conditional probabilities:
$$
p(X) = \prod_{t=1}^T p(x_t|x1, ..., x_{t-1})
$$

### Dilated Causal Convolutions

- receptive field = layers + filter length - 1
- Dilated convolution is adopted
